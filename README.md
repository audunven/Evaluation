# Evaluation

This repository contains material used to evaluate the semantic matching artefacts across three datasets (ATM, Cultural Heritage and OAEI 2011). For each dataset the following material is provided:
* Dataset Descriptions
* Ontologies related to each dataset.
* Reference Alignments used as a baseline for the evaluation.
* Alignments produced by the individual matching algorithms and their combination.
