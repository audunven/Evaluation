# Evaluation

This repository contains material used to evaluate the semantic matching artefacts across three datasets (ATM, Cross-Domain and OAEI 2011). For each dataset the following material is provided:
* Ontologies related to each dataset.
* Reference Alignments used as a baseline for the evaluation.
* Alignments produced by the individual matching algorithms, the combination methods, and the State-of-the-art (SOTA) matching systems.
* Spreadsheets holding all evaluation results for the individual matching algorithms, the combination methods and the SOTA systems.
